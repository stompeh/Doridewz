# Doridewz

This program was created to become familiarized with the Win32 API while having a bit of fun.
Do not use on a system that is not yours. Icons will be overwritten.

Doridewz locates all .EXE files on any local disk it can find. The icons inside the EXE are replaced with a Mountain Dew can.
