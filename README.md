# Doridewz

This program was created to become familiarized with the Win32 API while having a bit of fun.
Do not use on a system that is not yours. Icons will be overwritten.

Doridewz locates all .EXE files on local (possibly shared, not tested) disks it can find. The icons inside the EXE are replaced with a Mountain Dew can .ico
